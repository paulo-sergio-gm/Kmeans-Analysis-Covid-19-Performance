# Kmeans Analysis Covid-19 Performance
In this analysis, we perform Kmeans to group 112 countries according to 12 selected variables from the [data on COVID-19](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). We took a data set as of April 26, 2022 that includes features such as total cases per million, total deaths per million, total persons vaccinated per percent. Also, health antecedents present in the COVID-19 dataset were included, such as the death rate from cardiovascular disease, prevalence of diabetes, share of men and women who smoke, as well as median age and life expectancy for each country. Variables like Excess Mortality and Hospital & ICU were discarded because they had too few values. The final results can be visualized in the following dashboard: [Kmeans Analysis Covid-19 Performance](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/paulo.garcia2729/viz/KmeansAnalysisCovid-19Performance/ClusteredCountries#1)
